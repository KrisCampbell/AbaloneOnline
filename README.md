## How to Play

### Game Rules

Abalone is a strategy board game for two players. The objective is to push six of your opponent's pieces off the board.

**Setup:**
- Each player starts with 14 pieces arranged in a triangular formation
- Black pieces start at the top, white pieces at the bottom

**Movement:**
1. **Single Piece:** Move one piece to an adjacent empty space
2. **Line Movement:** Move 2-3 pieces in a straight line
3. **Pushing:** Push opponent pieces when you have numerical advantage (2v1 or 3v2)

**Winning:**
- First player to push 6 opponent pieces off the board wins

### Controls

- **Click** to select pieces
- **Click again** to add pieces to selection (up to 3 in a line)
- **Click destination** to move selected pieces
- **Escape** to clear selection
- **Ctrl+R** to reset game
- **Ctrl+Z** to undo last move (local games only)

## Development

### Project Structure

```
Abalone/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main HTML file
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css          # Game styling
â”œâ”€â”€ game.js            # Core game logic and board rendering
â”œâ”€â”€ multiplayer.js     # WebRTC multiplayer implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ main.js           # UI management and initialization
â””â”€â”€ README.md         # This file
```

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Or serve with a local HTTP server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx serve .
   
   # Using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

### Game Architecture

- **AbaloneGame** (`game.js`): Core game logic, board state, move validation
- **MultiplayerManager** (`multiplayer.js`): WebRTC connection management
- **Main** (`main.js`): UI updates, event handling, game initialization

### Adding Features

The modular architecture makes it easy to extend:

- **New game modes**: Extend `AbaloneGame` class
- **Better signaling**: Replace localStorage signaling in `MultiplayerManager`
- **AI opponent**: Add computer player logic
- **Tournament mode**: Add multiple game support

## Technical Details

### WebRTC Implementation

The multiplayer uses WebRTC DataChannels for real-time communication:

- **Signaling**: Simple localStorage-based signaling (works for local testing)
- **ICE Servers**: Google STUN servers for NAT traversal
- **Data Format**: JSON messages for game state synchronization

### Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 11+
- Edge 79+

WebRTC support is required for multiplayer functionality.

### Mobile Support

The game is fully responsive and works on mobile devices:
- Touch controls for piece selection and movement
- Adaptive canvas sizing
- Mobile-optimized UI layout

## Troubleshooting

### Multiplayer Connection Issues

1. **"Game not found"**: Code might be expired or mistyped
2. **"Connection timeout"**: Firewall or NAT issues, try different network
3. **Disconnect during game**: WebRTC connection lost, try reconnecting

### Game Issues

1. **Pieces won't move**: Check if it's your turn and move is valid
2. **Board not rendering**: Try refreshing the page
3. **Mobile controls**: Use single taps, avoid dragging
